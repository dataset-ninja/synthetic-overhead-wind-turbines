**Synthetic Overhead Images of Wind Turbines Made to Mimic California and Arizona** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the energy industry. The dataset presented here is not the original one. Learn more on the dataset's homepage.

The dataset consists of 400 images with 2325 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wind turbines*).

Images in the California and Arizona Wind Turbines (by Duke Dataplus2020) dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 22 (6% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
